# NeuralNet

For this Neural Network project, I want/wanted to make an emotion detector. Well, what IS an emotion detector? Well it detects emotions... but more precisely, it reads in text input (if I have time, if I don't it will just be a general text input from a txt, not from the console) then tells the user which of the four target emotions it falls most accurately with. These four target emotionso are subject for change, but at the current moment I want to have Happy, Sad, Angry, and Calm as my four key emotions. Yes, Calm is not as strong of an emotion compared to Sadness, Happiness, or Anger, but I need a 'catch all' option for sentences that don't emote much. For example, 'the car is blue' has no emotion to it, so 'Calm' should be the selected emotion. I will be training this AI by sending in a compilation of phrases and sentences that clearly display the four emotions, teaching it to expect those, and then narrowing down the sentences to be a little more nuanced. Complexity and Accuracy of this project will heavily rely on how much time I have, and if I'm able to complete tasks in time. In other words, only time can tell...
